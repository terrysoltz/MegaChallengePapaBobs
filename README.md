A .NET web forms database first application example from a DevU instructional video series. The application allows a user to place a pizza order that is stored in a database table. The price is automatically updated as options such as size and toppings are selected, based on prices queried from a separate table. The application also creates a manager page that lists current orders and allows the user to log an order as completed. The application also serves as an example of layered architecture, using data transfer objects to segregate method functionality between operational layers.
